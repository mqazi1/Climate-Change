<h1> Climate Change </h1>
<h6> Abstract </h6>
<p class="double"> 
This website evaluates how the climate is changing and impacting Earth in a negative way. Climate change has a lot of negative effects on the environment and it is mostly because of the people.
If people can change their habits to reduce the greenhouse gases emissions, then we might be able to save uncountable amount of species as well as humans. At its worst condition, global warming
could wipe out and destroy all the species through natural causes.
